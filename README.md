### C# Portfolio: Bill of Accomplishment

This final project demonstrates fundamental C# concepts with best practices coding conventions. The end result was to create a reference portfolio of known good source code to show potential employers and for future projects. As a result, one of the goals was to improve readability by implementing consistent commenting, naming, and layout conventions.

Project components (tasks) for each sample program:
1) find suitable example programs hopefully written by professional programmers,
2) carefully read the program code to figure out (as much as possible) what the program does and how it does it
3) document your findings by annotating the code with program comments that demonstrate your understanding of the program
4) compile and get the program running... debug it if necessary
5) augment the program to better demonstrate its functionality
6) capture the program output and append it to the end of your source code

The following were included as much as possible.
1) the original source code of the sample program
2) document the source and (if possible) the author of the sample program
3) summarize the program functionality in a one-liner comment
4) summarize your changes and improvements to the program
5) the final source code of the sample program
6) a terminal comment containing the sample program output
